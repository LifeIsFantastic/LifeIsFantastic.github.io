## About Me
I'm currently a 3rd year Ph.D. candidate at [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/) advised by Dr. [Jia Pan](https://sites.google.com/site/panjia/). I recevied a M.Sc from [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), advised by Dr. [Chao Xu](http://www.kivact.com/chao-xu/). My work lies in the intersection between computer graphics and robotics, with a focus on 3D reconstruction of dynamic scenes.
